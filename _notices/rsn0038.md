## Overview

Pasacl GPU support is now removed in RAPIDS release `v24.02`, and use of Pascal may lead to failures or incorrect responses.

## Impact

RAPIDS will no longer support Pascal GPUs. GPUs with Compute Capability 7.0 or higher will be required. Users of Pascal GPUs will be able to continue to use RAPIDS `v23.12`.

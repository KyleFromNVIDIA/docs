## Overview

`cudf 23.10.1` introduced a faulty regression that affects both `dask_cudf=23.10` and `cugraph=23.10`

## Rationale

When there are duplicate values in an index, Series constructor shouldn't be reindexing if there is a new index passed.

We need a reindex fix(to fix cudf) and safe_hash fix (to fix dask_cudf) to correct the fautly regression issue

## Impact

All users are recommended to use the latest `23.12 Nightly Version of RAPIDS until hotfix is completed.
